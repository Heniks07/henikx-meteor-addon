# Development

- Clone this repo and open it in your preferred IDE.
- To test, run the `Minecraft Client` configuration in your IDE.
  This will start a Minecraft client with the Meteor Client mod and this addon loaded.
- To build, run the gradle `build` task. This will create a JAR file in the `build/libs` folder.
    - Move the JAR file to the `mods` folder of your Minecraft installation, alongside the Meteor Client mod, and run the
